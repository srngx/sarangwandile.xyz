# New Domain purchased.

Recently I just purchased new domain "sarangwandile.xyz" from godaddy.

but something didint go well.

As soon i purchased it it went into black list of **Spam Eating Monkey**

```
SEM-FRESH — Domains registered in the last 5 days
SEM-FRESH10 — Domains registered in the last 10 days
SEM-FRESH15 — Domains registered in the last 15 days
SEM-FRESH30 — Domains registered in the last 30 days

```

And I was panick as It was rufusing to load my github pages static website (which would be this one)

I create hugo based personal website just to test this domain. And thought I would stick to it for at least one year.
but because of this panick I was angry onto godaddy for what deemed for me to be **bad service**
but then one friend told me to use cloudflare nameservers and I did.

and site is visible but still I can only see it with using vpn.

I need to do something regarding blacklisting.

and hugo site also not properly working and not showing images and another links at this point.

unto it.

bye.
