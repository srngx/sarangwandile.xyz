<h2>I just bought a New Domain</h2>
<p>srngx<br>
Dec 06,2024</p>
</header>
<p>	
Recently I just purchased new domain "sarangwandile.xyz" from godaddy.
but something didint go well.

As soon i purchased it it went into black list of <b>Spam Eating Monkey</b>
</p>
<pre><code>SEM-FRESH — Domains registered in the last 5 days
SEM-FRESH10 — Domains registered in the last 10 days
SEM-FRESH15 — Domains registered in the last 15 days
SEM-FRESH30 — Domains registered in the last 30 days
</code></pre>
<p>
And I was panick as It was rufusing to load my github pages static website (which would be this one)
</p>
<p>
I create hugo based personal website just to test this domain. And thought I would stick to it for at least one year.
but because of this panick I was angry onto godaddy for what deemed for me to be **bad service**
but then one friend told me to use cloudflare nameservers and I did.
</p>
<p>
and site is visible but still I can only see it with using vpn.
</p>
<p>
I need to do something regarding blacklisting.
</p>
<p>
and hugo site also not properly working and not showing images and another links at this point.
</p>
<p>
unto it.
</p>
<p>
bye.
</p>


<h2>Update:</h2>
<hr>
<p>
The Images not loading issue was because of hugo `baseUrl` configuration. <br>
This varialbe if set to domain or custom link it resolves the links relative to that url.<br><br>
So if I leave it empty <code>basUrl = ""</code> and ran with <code>hugo server</code> command it automatically assumes <code>localhost:1313</code> for base url. <br><br>but if set to another url like <code>example.com</code> it try it use it.
but my static site wasnt deployed using hugo framework from cloudflare I just build hugo site on windows and push it to github repo and cloudflare pages will statically serve the pages in "/public" folder.
<p>
	
<p>

So upon changin baseUrl to "/" just works and fixed the issue.<br><br>
 
So ig now I have one less issue to fix.</p>

<h2>Another Update as on 08/12/2024</h2>
<p>It turns out these blacklist will automatically clear my domain after 5 days<br><br>
Fortunately it seems to fixed itself and now I dont have to wait for 5 days and <u>I can load my website without vpn now.</u>
</p>

<h3>Todo</h3>
<ul>
<li> [x] Fixing images and relative urls not showing</li>
<li> [x] Removing domain from blacklisting  
</li>
</ul>

<h3> Notes for self</h3>

<p>
When building site with hugo always use with these <code>flags</code> if you dont want to regret later.
</p>

<pre><code>hugo server --baseURL https://example.org/ --appendPort=false 
</code></pre>

<p>
additionally you can also add <code>baseUrl="https://example.org"</code> in your <code>hugo.yaml</code>
