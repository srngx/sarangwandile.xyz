To learn about generating one of em click on this link\nLeverage GitHub\u0026rsquo;s REST API Making an API Request to Enumerate Repositories\nGitHub\u0026rsquo;s REST API allows you to interact with user data, including listing their private repositories.\nGenerate a Request with the Personal Access Token The endpoint for listing repositories is:\nGET /user/repos However, you need to add an authorization header with the personal access token to authenticate. You can do this using curl, Python (requests), or other HTTP clients.\nWe will be using curl to enumerate repos.\ncurl -H \u0026#34;Authorization: token \u0026lt;your_personal_access_token\u0026gt;\u0026#34; \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/user/repos\u0026#34; This will return JSON response with the list of both public and private repos.\nbut we want only private repos so we apend ?visibility=private however its still giving us unwanted output but we want only list of repos so here comes jq for the rescue - a json processor.\nSo this is full command looks like\ncurl -H \u0026#34;Authorization: token ghp_R7DSrylV1uUoxxxxxxSUcfBXl2E4FK7lc\u0026#34; \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/user/repos?visibility=private\u0026#34; | jq -r \u0026#39;.[].html_url\u0026#39; Expected output:\nhttps://github.com/elon/x-secret-project https://github.com/elon/ai-countermeasures https://github.com/elon/my-friends-on-mars Now that we learned we have access to private repos lets try modifying and pushing code of any one repository.\nBut first we clone the repo using token because its private.\nGit cloning the repo # syntax git clone https://username:\u0026lt;token\u0026gt;@github.com/username/repository.git # command in my case git clone https://srngx:ghp_R7DSrylV1uUoPT2HhSSxxxSUcfBXl2E4FK7lc@github.com/srngx/private_repo.git Pushing to Repo touch somefile git add somefile git commit -m \u0026#34;testing PAT\u0026#34; Push using token\ngit push origin main When asked for password use token instead of password.\nalso if you\u0026rsquo;re passing the token in the clone URL (as shown earlier), it will automatically authenticate for pushing as well, and you won’t be prompted for username/password.\ngit push https://username:ghp_exampletoken1234@github.com/username/private-repo.git Note If you dont have github global config setup it will use the private repo owners name and email. but if you want to leave your imprint (which malicious hacker wont normally do) and add yourself in contributors list in your victims github repo then you can setup global config.\ngit config --global user.name \u0026#34;your name\u0026#34; git config --global user.email \u0026#34;you@email.com\u0026#34; also you can use something like Git Credential Helper to store your credentials securely to avoid manually entering username and password everytime you use git push.\ngit config --global credential.helper cache Mitigations Mitigation Steps If a PAT Is Exposed\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve exposed your PAT publicly, take immediate action to protect your account:\nRevoke the Exposed PAT Goto your Github Developer Settings And Delete or Revoke that token. Generate a New PAT Create new token and this time try to not exposing it. Audit Your Account: Review recent activity in your repositories for any suspicious actions (commits, issues, pull requests, etc.). Check if any unauthorized changes were made to your repositories or account settings. Use More Secure Storage for Tokens: Environment variables: Store tokens in environment variables, not in the code. Password managers: Use a password manager to securely store and manage tokens. GitHub Secrets: For CI/CD pipelines, use GitHub Actions secrets or other secure vaults to store tokens. Set Appropriate Scopes for PATs: Always limit the scope of your tokens to the least privilege required. For example, if you only need read access, do not grant write or admin access. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Enable two-factor authentication on your GitHub account for an added layer of protection in case your credentials are compromised.

Git is a Distributed Version Control System that mainly used for Source code management by developers.\nGit basically divides your code into three part.\nWorking Area Staging Area Head or commit Working Area is your state of code before running the git add command.

Test (Here your code is being tested against performance and security standards.)

It lets you create a secure and isolated space for your resources, like your own little corner of the internet in AWS with all the required tools to create a network such as subnets, route table, internet gateway, VPNs, etc.\nLoad Balancer: Distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances so your application can handle more users and is more resilient.\nCloudWatch: Monitors your AWS resources and applications, collecting metrics and logs to help you understand performance and troubleshoot issues.\nAws provide cloudwatch service to monitor and manage logs of resources to help user getting better performance and troubleshoot issues.\nCloudFront: A content delivery network (CDN) that makes your websites and applications faster by caching content closer to your users.\nCloudfront is aws managed CDN to caching the content closer to users to make websites and applications faster.\nS3 (Simple Storage Service): Like a hard drive in the cloud for storing all sorts of files, from websites to backups.\nAws managed storage service like a Google drive to store all sorts of files and store backups\nEFS (Elastic File System): A network file system that lets you share files between multiple EC2 instances.\nRDS (Relational Database Service): Makes it easy to set up and manage databases in the cloud, like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.\nRoute 53: A scalable DNS service that translates domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses.\nLambda: Lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers; you only pay for the compute time you use. Serverless compute\nSNS (Simple Notification Service): A messaging service that can send notifications to various destinations, like email, SMS, and other applications.\nSQS (Simple Queue Service): Like a post office box in the cloud. You put messages in it (like tasks to be done), and other services can pick them up later. This helps keep different parts of your application loosely connected and make things more reliable.\nEBS (Elastic Block Store): Think of it as a fast hard drive in the cloud.
