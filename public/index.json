[{"content":"What is Git? Git is a Distributed Version Control System that mainly used for Source code management by developers.\nGit basically divides your code into three part.\nWorking Area Staging Area Head or commit Working Area is your state of code before running the git add command. The files in here also known as \u0026ldquo;untracked files\u0026rdquo;.\nTo add the files into git you do git add and they moved to staging area.\nHere your code got the stage.\nBefore finalizing your code into production i.e. \u0026lsquo;commit\u0026rsquo; you make required changes and after making sure your code is ready to go into production you run git commit command. which is basically telling git this is a final changes with the special stamp of \u0026ldquo;commit hash\u0026rdquo;.\nThen If you want you can push your code into remote repository sitting onto the cloud waiting to be forked and contributed by peoples across the glob.\nBasic Git commands git add To add code into git git commit To commit changes git push To upload your code into remote repo git pull To download latest changes from remote to your local git fetch Fetching Metadata and logs from remote Branching Strategies Git Provide \u0026ldquo;Branches\u0026rdquo; which are nothing but a way to seperate your code into different version so you can later integrate your features and bugfixes into production once they finished peacefully in their own isolated places.\nThere are well known three branches people generally creates:\nMain (which is your production branch) Dev (which is your ongoing development which never cease to stop.) Test (Here your code is being tested against performance and security standards.) Some people also like to create their own custom branches like alpha, beta, stable etc i.e. according to release state.\nCommands Related to Branches git branch -a List all available branches git checkout -b Create and switch to the new branch git checkout To switch to different branch ","permalink":"https://sarangwandile.xyz/notes/git_notes/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-git\"\u003eWhat is Git?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGit is a \u003cstrong\u003eDistributed Version Control System\u003c/strong\u003e that mainly used for Source code management by developers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGit basically divides your code into three part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorking Area\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStaging Area\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHead or commit\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorking Area is your state of code before running the \u003ccode\u003egit add\u003c/code\u003e command.\nThe files in here also known as \u0026ldquo;untracked files\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo add the files into git you do \u003ccode\u003egit add\u003c/code\u003e and they moved to \u003ccode\u003estaging area\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Git Notes"},{"content":"This is the list of AWS resources required for Entry level devops interview preparation. Sometimes we struggle to explain the definition we already know it\u0026rsquo;s usecase in simpler terms. So I curated this list. The ones written in Italian is my own hand crafted lines while others mostly generated from Gemini Ai.\nEC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Like renting virtual computers in the cloud, you can run whatever software you want on them.\nIts like vps or vms in the cloud, they are scalable, flexible and cheaper.\nVPC is like having your own private network within the cloud. It lets you create a secure and isolated space for your resources, like your own little corner of the internet in AWS with all the required tools to create a network such as subnets, route table, internet gateway, VPNs, etc.\nLoad Balancer: Distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances so your application can handle more users and is more resilient.\nCloudWatch: Monitors your AWS resources and applications, collecting metrics and logs to help you understand performance and troubleshoot issues.\nAws provide cloudwatch service to monitor and manage logs of resources to help user getting better performance and troubleshoot issues.\nCloudFront: A content delivery network (CDN) that makes your websites and applications faster by caching content closer to your users.\nCloudfront is aws managed CDN to caching the content closer to users to make websites and applications faster.\nS3 (Simple Storage Service): Like a hard drive in the cloud for storing all sorts of files, from websites to backups.\nAws managed storage service like a Google drive to store all sorts of files and store backups\nEFS (Elastic File System): A network file system that lets you share files between multiple EC2 instances.\nRDS (Relational Database Service): Makes it easy to set up and manage databases in the cloud, like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.\nRoute 53: A scalable DNS service that translates domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses.\nLambda: Lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers; you only pay for the compute time you use. Serverless compute\nSNS (Simple Notification Service): A messaging service that can send notifications to various destinations, like email, SMS, and other applications.\nSQS (Simple Queue Service): Like a post office box in the cloud. You put messages in it (like tasks to be done), and other services can pick them up later. This helps keep different parts of your application loosely connected and make things more reliable.\nEBS (Elastic Block Store): Think of it as a fast hard drive in the cloud. You can attach it to an EC2 instance (your virtual computer) to store data. This is great for things like databases or file storage.\nEbs is like virtual hard drive that can be attached to ec2 instances and its scalable and you can adjust performance and type according to your need.\n","permalink":"https://sarangwandile.xyz/notes/aws_services_simply_explained/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis is the list of AWS resources required for Entry level devops interview preparation.

And thought I would stick to it for at least one year. but because of this panick I was angry onto godaddy for what deemed for me to be bad service but then one friend told me to use cloudflare nameservers and I did.\nand site is visible but still I can only see it with using vpn.\nI need to do something regarding blacklisting.\nand hugo site also not properly working and not showing images and another links at this point.\nunto it.\nbye.\nUpdate The Images not loading issue was because of hugo baseUrl configuration. This varialbe if set to domain or custom link it resolves the links relative to that url.
